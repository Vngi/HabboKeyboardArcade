# Mouse Control with Letter Keys

This Python script allows you to associate letter keys with specific positions on the screen and perform double-click actions at those positions when the corresponding key is pressed. It utilizes the `pyautogui` and `pynput` libraries to control the mouse and listen for keyboard events.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script file (`Snake.py and Snake.bat`) to your local machine.
3. This depends on the verison you download WASD or Arrowkeys, however it's the same process!

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required:
- these are auto installed for you when you run the .bat
- `pyautogui`: Used for controlling the mouse and performing double-click actions.
- `pynput`: Used for listening to keyboard events.

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
Run the Snake.bat
Click on the desired areas of the screen in the following order:

Click the position for 'W'
Click the position for 'A'
Click the position for 'S'
Click the position for 'D'
Once the positions are set, you can use the corresponding letter keys ('w', 'a', 's', 'd') to perform double-click actions at the associated positions on the screen.

To exit the script, simply close the terminal or press Ctrl+C.
